Your README structure is mostly clear, but there are a few inconsistencies and redundancies. Here's an improved and correctly ordered version:

# lstty

`lstty` is a Python-based command-line tool to list available serial ports. It prints the name of the serial port, the type of port, and if it's a USB port, it will include the VID, PID, and product name. Currently, there are no command-line parameters—just run `lstty` to see the output.

## Features

- Lists available serial ports.
- Displays port type (e.g., USB, Bluetooth, PCI, etc.).
- Includes USB-specific details like VID, PID, and product description.
- Outputs information in a clear ASCII table format.

### Example Output
```text
$ lstty
Port            Type       Details
----------------------------------------------------------------------
/dev/ttyS0      unknown    
/dev/ttyS1      unknown    
/dev/ttyACM0    usb        VID:PID=2E8A RaspberryPi Pico
```

## Installation

To install `lstty`, clone this repository and run:

```bash
pip install .
```

Currently, `lstty` is not available on PyPI.

## Dependencies

This tool relies on the following Python libraries:
- [pyserial](https://github.com/pyserial/pyserial) – for serial port information.
- [click](https://click.palletsprojects.com/en/stable/) – for the command-line interface.

Install them via `pip`:

```bash
pip install pyserial click
```

## Acknowledgments

This tool was inspired by the original [lstty](https://github.com/atctwo/lstty) project by [@atctwo](https://github.com/atctwo). Special thanks to the original author for creating the Rust-based implementation that served as the foundation for this Python adaptation.

### Key Adjustments:
1. **Order Consistency**: Installation and dependencies should come before building.
2. **Rust Section Clarification**: Make it clear that the Rust section pertains to the original version, as this adaptation is Python-based.
3. **Example Output Placement**: The example output should be part of the "Features" section for better flow.
4. **Consistency in Headers**: Use consistent header sizes and language for clarity.

This refined structure ensures clarity, proper organization, and ease of understanding for users and contributors.
